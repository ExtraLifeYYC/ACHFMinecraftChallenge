# ACHFMinecraftChallenge

## Welcome to the Alberta Children's Hospital Extra Life Minecraft Build Challenge
Attached to this repository is a Scale replica of the Alberta Children's Hospital (even though it's scaled down, it's still very big) 
We're hoping that you can take this world and build an amazing and fun park that kids who are staying as patients at the hospital will find fun!

### Rules:
- Do not destroy the hospital (to be extra safe, make sure your role is Member and it will keep you from destroying the hospital by accident)
- No violence or offensive language - there may be younger kids that look at your awesome build
- Be creative - it's not just about the biggest build, think about colours, redstone blocks, command blocks, anything you can use at your disposal.
